Why does the current ""choose"" the correct return path and not bypass any other ground connections anywhere in the circuit?', ""Note that this is usually only used with immutable items (strings, tuples, frozensets, etc) in the list, because they all point to the same item in the same place in memory. For an example use-case, I use this when I have to build a table with a schema of all strings, so that I don't have to give a highly redundant one to one mapping. ... Multiplying a list gives us the same elements over and over."", 'The list will not be cloned: all the elements will refer to the same list! >>> x=[5] >>> y=[x] * 4 >>> y [[5], [5], [5], [5]] >>> y[0][0] = 6 >>> y [[6], [6], [6], [6]] ... Depending on your use-case, you want to use different techniques with different semantics. For immutable items, like None, bools, ints, floats, strings, tuples, or frozensets, you can do it like this:', 'Should be range() instead xrange(). Example: my_list``` = [1 for _ in range(10)]; and my_list will be [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] ... Sorry for my really late answer You can use numpy.repeat easily.

The inputs should be passed individually according to the function signature. Review how the function is being called and ensure that the inputs are provided correctly to match the function parameters.
