",is_not_prime,"The issue in the code provided by the student is related to the logic for determining if a number is prime or not. Here are some points to address:

1. The function name is_is_not_prime is not following the correct naming convention. It should be is_not_prime instead.

2. The function logic to determine if a number is not prime is almost correct, but there is an issue with the return values. The function should return True if the number is not prime and False if the number is prime. The logic for the base cases and the loop checking for divisibility seems fine.

3. The base case checks seem inverted. The function should return True for non-prime numbers and False for prime numbers. So, the return statements in the base cases should be adjusted accordingly.

4. In the loop that checks for divisibility, the function should return True as soon as it finds a number that divides n without any remainder, indicating that n is not prime. Currently, the function returns True in the loop but should return False at the end of the loop if no divisor is found.

5. The function should return False for the number 2 as it is a prime number. The current implementation returns False, which is incorrect.

The issue you are facing with the test case `has_duplicates([])` is because you are iterating over an empty list, and `unique_elements.add(element)` will not raise an exception if `element is None`. This doesn't violate the condition `element in unique_elements` since `None` is not in the set. In this case, you can convert `None` to another value before adding it to the set.

",odd_Equivalent,"The issue with the current implementation is that it doesn't correctly handle the case where the binary number has more than one odd-numbered value after rotating. 

To find the number of numbers with an odd value when rotating a binary string the given number of times, you need to simulate the rotations on the binary number and count the odd numbers that appear during the process.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def odd_Equivalent(binary_str, rotations):
    count_odd = 0

    # Convert the binary string to an integer
    num = int(binary_str, 2)

    # Count the number of odd numbers after rotating the binary string

    return count_odd

# Test cases
assert odd_Equivalent(""011001"", 6) == 3
assert odd_Equivalent(""1100110011"", 5) == 4
```

In the corrected code:
- We initialize a `count_odd` variable to keep track of the number of odd values found.
- We then perform the rotations on the binary number by shifting the bits to the left and right appropriately.
- For each rotation, we check if the new number is odd and increment the `count_odd` if it is.

With this correction, the function should now correctly count the number of odd values after rotating the binary string."

",find_length,"In your current approach, you are calculating the total count of 0s and 1s in the entire binary string, but the question requires finding the maximum difference between the number of 0s and 1s in any sub-string of the given binary string.

To fix this issue, you need to iterate through all possible sub-strings of the binary string and find the maximum difference between the count of 0s and 1s for each sub-string.

Here is an updated version of your function that calculates the correct result:
```python
def find_length(binary_string):
    max_diff = 0
    
    for i in range(len(binary_string)):
        count_0 = 0
        count_1 = 0

# Test the function

```

This updated function iterates through all sub-strings by using two loops and calculates the difference between the count of 0s and 1s for each sub-string. Finally, it returns the maximum difference found among all sub-strings.

You can now test this updated function with different inputs to verify its correctness."

",is_undulating,"The issue in the provided code is due to going out of the range while comparing consecutive digits in the number sequence. Additionally, the current implementation only checks if the last pair of digits are in rising order without considering if there are multiple instances of rise and fall in the number.

Here is the feedback and the corrected code:

1. **Index Out of Range**: When comparing consecutive digits, ensure that you do not go out of the valid index range. The loop should iterate only up to the second last digit to avoid the 'index out of range' error.

2. **Handling Multiple Instances**: The current code only checks if there is a rise at the end of the number. To determine if the number is undulating, you need to check for multiple rises and falls in the number.

3. **Resetting the Flag**: When resetting the is_undulating flag, you should break out of the loop as soon as you find a pair of digits that do not follow the rise and fall pattern.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def is_undulating(num):
    num_str = str(num)

    if len(num_str) < 3:
        return False 
    
    is_undulating = False

",even_bit_set_number,"The student's implementation has some issues. Here's the feedback to help fix the code:

1. The current approach of creating a string representation of the even bits (alternating '0' and '1') is incorrect. Instead, you should retain the original bits of the number but set the even bits to 0. Imagine ignoring the 0-based indexing convention of bits (e.g., 0th bit is the LSB).

2. When setting even bits to 0, you need to keep the odd bits unchanged. One way to achieve this is by using bit manipulation operations like bitwise AND (&) and bitwise OR (|).

Here's an improved version of the function that sets all even bits to 0:

1. Incorrect data structure: The student is passing a 3D list instead of a 2D list of tuples as input. The input should be a list of tuples, not nested lists of lists. Update the input data structure accordingly.

2. Invalid condition: The condition `if len(tuples[i]) == 1 and len(tuples[j]) == 1` in the product calculation is incorrect. Since the input tuples are always of size 2, this condition is unnecessary and potentially leads to errors. You should directly calculate the product of the first elements of each tuple.

3. Recursion error: The function tries to call itself recursively with `max_product_tuple(tuples[i]) * max_product_tuple(tuples[j])`, which is incorrect and will lead to a recursion error. You should calculate the product of the first elements of the tuples instead.

4. Incorrect indexing: The tuples are accessed incorrectly using square brackets with numeric indexes instead of using parentheses. Tuples should be accessed using parentheses, not square brackets.

5. Initial value for `max_product_tuple`: The initial value for `max_product_tuple` should be set as an empty tuple `(None, None)` instead of `None`.

1. Correction in if condition inside the loop:
    In the current code, the condition `if arr[i] > arr[end]` is incorrect. The idea is to handle the increasing and decreasing parts of the bitonic subsequence. You should be checking whether we are in increasing or decreasing portion of the sequence. So it should be modified to check if we are in the increasing phase or decreasing phase.

2. Incorrect start index update:
    In the else block where you update the `current_sum` and `max_sum`, you are setting the `start` index to `end - 1`, but it should be `end` because you are starting a new increasing sequence from this index.

3. Proper initialization of `start` and `end`:
    You should initialize `start` with 0 and `end` with 1 (first two elements form an initial increasing sequence).

4. Initializing `current_sum` properly:
    Initialize the `current_sum` with the value of the first element of the array.

In this test case, you are checking for the count of element '4' in the tuple `(10, 8, 5, 2, 10, 15, 10, 8, 5, 8, 8, 2)`. However, '4' is not present in the tuple, and your function should correctly return 0 for this case.

The issue is not with the implementation of the `count_occurrences` function; rather, it lies in the incorrect value passed in this specific test case.

Additionally, for the test case `assert count_occurrences((a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l), 3) == 2`, you need to ensure that `a`, `b`, `c`, ..., `l` are defined as values.

",zero_count,"The code is partially correct. To fix the code and make it work, you need to do the following:

1. Import the `math` module at the beginning of your code since you are using the `math.isclose` function.
2. The `math.isclose` function requires importing the `math` module. So add `import math` at the beginning of your code.
3. Handle the case when the input list is empty. Currently, the code does not handle this case, so you should check if the list is empty and return 0 if there are no elements in the input array.
4. In the test case, the expected value should be adjusted to match the ratio of zeroes to non-zeroes for the given input list.
5. The function name in the test case needs to be changed from `zero_count` to `zero_to_non_zero_ratio`.

",add_pairwise,"The student is very close to the correct answer. 

To fix the code, there are two main issues that need to be addressed:

1. The input tuple should not be wrapped in extra square brackets when calling the function. For example, instead of `[[1, 5, 7, 8, 10]]`, it should be `(1, 5, 7, 8, 10)`.

2. The student's implementation of the function needs to adjust the range of the for loop to correctly calculate the pairwise addition. Since the last element doesn't have a neighbor to add to, the loop should only go up to `len(tup) - 1`. Also, to return a tuple as the output, the student should use tuple() function to convert the list to a tuple before returning it.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def add_pairwise(tup):
    # Ensure the tuple has at least two elements
    if len(tup) < 2:
        raise ValueError(""Tuple must have at least two elements for pairwise addition."")

When using f-strings in Python, you need to ensure that the placeholders are in the correct order for the values to substitute correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

By adjusting the placeholders to `{day:02d}-{month:02d}-{year}`, you ensure that day and month are represented with leading zeros if necessary. This will correctly convert the date format from `yyyy-mm-dd` to `dd-mm-yyyy`.

",count_Pairs,"The feedback I can provide to help you solve the problem is as follows:

1. You are not providing the second argument `n`, as specified in the question. The function count_Pairs should take two arguments: the list of integers and the integer `n` representing the length of the input list.

2. The code is incrementing the count for each pair where elements are unequal, but the question is asking for the number of possible unordered pairs. You are counting every pair where the elements are different without considering if both elements are used in other pairs or not.

3. To find the number of possible unordered pairs where both elements are unequal, you need to modify the logic. One way to approach this is by using combinations from the itertools library. Here's an updated version of the function:

```python
from itertools import combinations

def count_Pairs(lst, n):
    unique_pairs = set()
    for pair in combinations(lst, 2):
        if pair[0] != pair[1]:
            unique_pairs.add(tuple(sorted(pair)))
    return len(unique_pairs)
```

This code now uses combinations to find all pairs of elements in the list and only adds the pair to a set if the elements are unequal. It also converts pairs to tuples after sorting them to have a unique representation for each pair.

",sumofFactors,"The issue in the student's code is that they are iterating through all numbers from 1 to n and checking if each number is even, which is not the correct approach to finding the sum of even factors of a number.

To fix the code, the student needs to follow a different approach to find the sum of the even factors of a number.

Here's the corrected approach and code:

```python
def sumofFactors(n):
    # Initialize the sum with zero
    sum = 0
    
    # Iterate through all numbers from 1 to n
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if n % i == 0 and i % 2 == 0:  # Check if i is a factor of n and even
            sum += i

    return sum

# Test the function with the given input
assert sumofFactors(18) == 26
```

With this correction, the code now correctly finds the sum of even factors of a number. The function goes through all factors of the number n and includes only the even factors in the sum.

This approach should provide the expected result for the given test case and other inputs as well."

- I used `[1:]` to skip the first element created by the split (which is an empty string before the first quotation mark).
- I used `[::2]` to take every second element after the split, which will be the words within the quotation marks.
- Then, I used `strip('""')` to remove the quotation marks from the extracted words.

",max_sub_array_sum,"Here are some feedback points to help you fix your code:

1. In the problem statement, the function is expected to take two arguments - the list of integers and the length of the list. However, in your current implementation, the function only takes one argument `arr`. You need to modify your function signature to accept both `arr` and `n`.

2. The loop in your current implementation is not correctly finding the maximum sum of a contiguous sublist. It seems like you are trying to apply the Kadane's algorithm, but the implementation is incorrect.

3. You are not correctly updating `max_sum` based on the `current_sum`. `max_sum` should store the maximum sum found so far.

4. Instead of comparing `arr[i] > arr[i - 1]`, you should compare `arr[i] + current_sum > arr[i]`. This comparison should decide whether to extend the current sublist or start a new one.

",last_Digit_Factorial,"The student's code looks mostly correct for the task of finding the last digit of the factorial of a given number. However, there is a logical flaw in the approach that is causing the issues.

1. **Logical Flaw**:
    - Using the modulus operator `%` by 10 is trying to find the last digit of the factorial by just extracting the remainder when divided by 10. This approach will only work for small values of n. For bigger values of n, the factorial number can be very large, and just finding the remainder by 10 is not sufficient to get the correct last digit.

    - To handle larger factorials, we should focus on finding a pattern in the last digits of factorials (the cyclical nature of last digits in factorials). For instance:
        - Factorials last digit for n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 cycles with a period of 20.
        - For n > 4, the last digit of the factorial repeats every 20 steps.

2. **Recommendation**:
    - To fix the code, you may consider taking only the last two digits of the factorial at each step of the loop. This will help avoid the overflow caused by calculating the entire factorial.
    - You can observe the last digit pattern for factorials and modify the code accordingly to get the correct last digit for any given n.

You should use recursion to handle all levels of nesting in the tuple correctly. The updated function checks if the item is a tuple and calls the `extract_even` function recursively. If the length of the extracted item is even, it adds that to the result.

1. The function `get_median` is defined to take only two arguments, `list1` and `list2`. However, the function call in the failed inputs includes three arguments: `[1, 12, 15, 26, 38], [2, 13, 17, 30, 45], 5`. You need to update the function definition to accept the size of the lists as well.

2. In the failed inputs, the lists are nested within another list `[[[1, 12, 15, 26, 38], [2, 13, 17, 30, 45], 5]]`. You need to pass the lists as two separate arguments instead of wrapping them into an outer list.

To fix the code:
```python
def get_median(list1, list2, size):
    # Merge the two lists into one sorted list
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    
    # If the length of the merged list is odd, the median is the middle element
    if len(merged_list) % 2 == 1:
        return merged_list[len(merged_list) // 2]
    
    # If the length of the merged list is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements
    else:
        return (merged_list[len(merged_list) // 2 - 1] + merged_list[len(merged_list) // 2]) / 2

# Test cases
print(get_median([1, 12, 15, 26, 38], [2, 13, 17, 30, 45], 5))
print(get_median([1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, 25, 28], [2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23, 26, 29], 10))

",pair_xor_Sum,"To fix the code and correct the failed inputs, you need to make the following adjustments:

1. The function `pair_xor_Sum` definition in the code does not match the function signature in the question. The function in the question expects two arguments (a list of numbers and the size of the list), but the student's function only takes one argument. Modify the function definition to accept both the list of numbers and the size as arguments.

2. The function signature should be changed to `def pair_xor_Sum(numbers, size):`

3. The function should be called with the correct number as the second argument. For example, `pair_xor_Sum([5, 9, 7, 6], 4)`.

",count_divisors,"The issue in the code is related to how the count of divisors is being calculated. The current implementation is not counting the divisors correctly.

To fix the code, you should consider the following approach:
- When you find a divisor `i`, there is another divisor `n // i` as well since `n` divided by any divisor gives another factor. However, if `i` and `n // i` are the same (which happens when `n` is a perfect square), you should only count it once.
- Instead of directly incrementing the `divisors` count, you can increment it by 2 for each pair of divisors.
- Additionally, you need to handle the case when the number itself is a perfect square. In this case, one of the divisors is counted twice, so you should increment the count by 1 only once (not twice).

In this corrected code:
- We initialize `current_group` with the first item of the list.
- Then, we iterate over the list and check if the current item is equal to the last item in the `current_group`. If so, we add the item to the `current_group`. If not, we append the `current_group` to the `result` and start a new `current_group`.
- Finally, we append the last `current_group`.

",get_coordinates,"Your approach to extract adjacent coordinates is on the right track, but there are a few mistakes in your code. Here are the issues and some feedback to help you fix the code:

1. Properly unpack the `coord_tuple`:
   - The `coord_tuple` contains the x and y coordinates as (x, y). You should correctly unpack the tuple to get the x and y values separately. You can do this using the following syntax: `x_coords, y_coords = coord_tuple`.

2. Adjust the range when creating coordinates:
   - The range for x coordinates should be from x - 1 to x + 1, and the range for y coordinates should be from y - 1 to y + 1 to obtain adjacent coordinates correctly.

3. Use correct iteration in list comprehension:
   - When generating adjacent coordinates, you need to iterate over a range of values starting from x - 1 to x + 2 for x-coordinates and y - 1 to y + 2 for y-coordinates.

4. Fix the returned data structure:
   - The function should return a list of lists where each inner list represents a pair of adjacent coordinates. You are currently concatenating two lists, which is not producing the correct result.

Here is an updated version of your function with the mentioned improvements:

```python

",combinations_colors,"The issue in your code is with how you are providing inputs to the `combinations_colors` function when you call it with `[[['Red', 'Green', 'Blue'], 2]][[['A', 'B', 'C', 'D'], 4]]`.

Instead of providing a nested list with the list of colors and the number, you should call the function with two separate arguments: the list of colors and the number.

Here is how you can fix it:

```python
# Calling the function with separate arguments
assert combinations_colors([""Red"", ""Green"", ""Blue""], 1) == [('Red',), ('Green',), ('Blue',)]

# Calling the function with separate arguments and storing the result
result1 = combinations_colors([""Red"", ""Green"", ""Blue""], 2)
result2 = combinations_colors([""A"", ""B"", ""C"", ""D""], 4)
print(result1)
print(result2)
```

After making this change, your function should work correctly. Remember to remove the nested list input and provide the arguments separately to the function."
